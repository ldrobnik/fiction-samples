# Nameless

It can see us from above as we try to hide among brambles, hoping it will mistake our human shapes and movements for those of boar or deer or badgers. We freeze, letting blood drip onto moss.

The buzzard does a figure of eight against the cruelly blue sky. The cloaking devices don't let it track us, but it still has its four camera eyes, movement detectors --- who knows how many --- and a machine gun. It seems to have a mind of its own, and I can't shake the impression that it knows all too well we have to come back for our boy.

I can call it a buzzard only inside my head. Perhaps you called it something else. Or maybe, after all those years together, we both came up with the same name, inspired by its looming presence, the silent buzzing sound it produces and the way it makes us feel like rodents in the fields. Finally, the buzzard flies away. We wait a few tense seconds and dash towards a thicket of spruces.

It was right before his second birthday, when you were having an affair and I pretended not to notice. We were at home, just the two of us. He couldn't sleep because of a headache. I lulled his warm tiny body in my arms, unable to stop thinking of what you might be doing. That stupid lamp you bought cast little lights on the walls and ceiling: blue birds over our heads, green trees all around us, slowly rotating in a dizzying loop. It was the only thing that could put him to sleep.

I look at the wound in your arm and try to tell you it's going to be okay, but all we can hear is a staccato of shattered syllables. If only there was a way to remove the implants. It's mind-blowing we were so thrilled to have them put inside our heads. Just think of it, you said, we'll be able to understand any language. Have all the world's knowledge at our synapses. But what we mostly used them for was liking stupid shit on other people's walls.

Now, we can't even speak our mother tongue.

Clearings are the scariest, bogs the most treacherous, glens the deadliest. In places, the forest is gaping mindlessly at the azure sky with its small lake eyes of the same colour. There are innumerable pines and birches and spruces and occasional oaks, raspberry bushes and dense clumps of ferns. There is the constant looking up, the throbbing of arteries, the instant freezing whenever we hear the barely audible buzz.

He looks as if he were asleep, save for the bullet hole in his head. Resting against the spiky mattress of pine needles, his red parka forms a vivid stain among the faded woody colours. His little eyes are peacefully fixed on the ruthless blue.

We scan the sky. Then slowly spin our heads, turning our ears into radars catching the faintest of noises. I gesture at you to stay and make a break for the centre of the clearing. With wobbly legs, I kneel on the ground and --- shedding no tear, giving no sob --- take his cold tiny body in my arms.

You cry out. It's a mess of short rustly sounds that could be reassembled into my name. There are buzzards above my head, an entire flock.
